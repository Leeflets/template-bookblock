            "entry":"<p>The Hon. Francis Gillette, in a speech in Hartford, Conn., in 1871, said\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat there was \"in Connecticut, on an average, one liquor shop to every\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforty voters, and three to every Christian church. In this city, as stated\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the _Hartford Times_, recently, we have five hundred liquor shops, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tone million eight hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars were, last\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyear, paid for intoxicating drinks. A cry, an appeal, came to me from the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcity, a few days since, after this wise: 'Our young men are going to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdestruction, and we want your influence, counsel, and prayers, to help\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsave them.'\"<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>In New London, report says, the young men are falling into drinking habits\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas never before. So in New Haven, Bridgeport, and the other cities and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlarge places of the state.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"The pulse of a person in health beats about seventy strokes a minute, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ordinary term of life is about seventy years. In these seventy years,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe pulse of a temperate person beats two billion five hundred and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tseventy-four million four hundred and forty thousand times. If no actual\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdisorganization should happen, a drunken person might live until his pulse\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeat this number of times; but by the constant stimulus of ardent spirits,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor by pulse-quickening food, or tobacco, the pulse becomes greatly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taccelerated, and the two billion five hundred and seventy-four million\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfour hundred and forty thousand pulsations are performed in little more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthan half the ordinary term of human life, and life goes out in forty or\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tforty-five years, instead of seventy. This application of numbers is given\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto show that the acceleration of those forces diminishes the term of human\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlife.\"<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"In New York, Mr. Greeley states that 'a much larger proportion of adult\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmales in the state drink now than did in 1840-44.' After speaking of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tadverse demonstrations all over the country, he adds, 'I cannot recall a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsingle decisive, cheering success, to offset these many reverses.'<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"Massachusetts is moving to build an asylum for her twenty-five thousand\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdrunkards. Lager beer brewers at Boston Highlands have three millions of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdollars invested in the business, manufactured four hundred and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tninety-five thousand barrels last year, and paid a tax of half a million\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto the general government. The city of Chicago, last year, received into\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ther treasury one hundred and ten thousand dollars for the sale of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindulgences to sell intoxicating drinks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"The same rate of fearful expenditure for intoxicating drinks extends\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tacross the ocean. In a speech before the Trades' Union Congress, last\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober, at Birmingham, 'on the disorganization of labor,' Mr. Potter\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshows drunkenness to be the great disorganizer of the labor of Great\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBritain, at a yearly cost of two hundred and twenty-eight million pounds,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tequal to one billion one hundred and forty million dollars; enough,\" he\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tadds, \"to pay the public debt of Great Britain in less than five years,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand greatly diminish taxation forever.\"<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span>From <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/41595\">\"The Funny Side of Physic\"<\/a> by A.

More _fret_ out. Mr. Beecher said, \"It is the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfretting that wears out the machinery; friction, not the real wear.\"<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"Choked with passion\" is no chimera; for passion often kills the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tunfortunate possessor of an irritable temper, sometimes suddenly. Care and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tover-anxiety sweep away thousands annually.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Let us see how long a man should live. The horse lives twenty-five years;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe ox fifteen or twenty; the lion about twenty; the dog ten or twelve;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe rabbit eight; the guinea-pig six or seven years. These numbers all\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbear a similar proportion to the time the animal takes to grow to its full\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsize. But man, of all animals, is the one that seldom comes up to his\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taverage. He ought to live a hundred years, according to this physiological\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlaw, for five times twenty are one hundred; but instead of that, he\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tscarcely reaches, on the average, four times his growing period; the cat\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsix times; and the rabbit even eight times the standard of measurement.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe reason is obvious. Man is not only the most irregular and the most\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tintemperate, but the most laborious and hard-worked of all animals. He is\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\talso the most irritable of all animals; and there is reason to believe,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthough we cannot tell what an animal secretly feels, that, more than any\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tother animal, man cherishes wrath to keep it warm, and consumes himself\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith the fire of his secret reflections.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"Age dims the lustre of the eye, and pales the roses on beauty's cheek;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhile crows' feet, and furrows, and wrinkles, and lost teeth, and gray\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thairs, and bald head, and tottering limbs, and limping, most sadly mar the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thuman form divine.

Dixon, I copy, with some abbreviation, the following, which\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe author terms \"Leaves from the Log-book of an Unfledged \u00c6sculapian:\"--<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"In the year 1830 I was sent forth, like our long-suffering and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmuch-abused prototype,--old father Noah's crow,--from the ark of safety,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe old St. Duane Street College. I pitched my tent, and set up my trap,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin what was then a fashionable up-town street.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"I hired a modest house, and had my arm-chair, my midnight couch, and my\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfew books in my melancholy little office, and I confess that I now and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthen left an amputating-knife, or some other awful-looking instrument, on\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe table, to impress the poor women who came to me for advice.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"These little matters, although the 'Academy' would frown upon them, I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconsidered quite pardonable. God knows I would willingly have adopted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir most approved method of a splendid residence, and silver-mounted\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tharnesses for my bays; but they were yet in dream-land, eating moonbeams,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand my vicious little nag had nearly all this time to eat his oats and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnurse his bad temper in his comfortable stable.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"In this miserable way I read over my old books, watered my\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trose-bushes,--sometimes with tears,--drank my tea and ate my toast, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\toccasionally listened to the complaint of an unfortunate Irish damsel,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith her customary account of 'a pain in me side an' a flutterin' about me\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\theart.' At rare intervals I ministered to some of her countrywomen in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir fulfilment of the great command when placed in the Garden of Eden.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(What a dirty place it would have been if inhabited by Irish women!)<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"And thus I spent nearly a year without a single call to any person of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcharacter. I think I should have left in despair if it had not been for a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlovely creature up the street. She was the wife of a distinguished fish\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmerchant down town.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"This lovely woman was Mrs. Mackerel. I will explain how it was that I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas summoned to her ladyship's mansion, and had the pleasure of seeing Mr.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMackerel, of the firm of 'Mackerel, Haddock &amp; Dun.'<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"One bitter cold night in January, just as I was about to retire, a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfurious ring at the front door made me feel particularly amiable! A\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tservant announced the sudden and alarming illness of Mrs. Mackerel, with\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe assurance that as the family physician was out of town, Mrs. M. would\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbe obliged if I would immediately visit her. Accordingly, I soon found\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmyself in the presence of the accomplished lady, having--I confess\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit--given my hair an extra touch as I entered the beautiful chamber.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"Mrs. Mackerel was not a bad-tempered lady; she was only a beautiful\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfool--nothing less, dear reader, or she would have never married old\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMackerel. Her charms would have procured her a husband of at least a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttolerable exterior. His physiognomy presented a remarkable resemblance to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\this namesake. Besides, he chewed and smoked, and the combination of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taroma of his favorite luxuries with the articles of his merchandise must\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave been most uncongenial to the curve of such lips and such nostrils as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMrs. Mackerel's.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"I was received by Mr. Mackerel in a manner that increased observation has\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsince taught me is sufficiently indicative of the hysterical _finale_ of a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdomestic dialogue. He was not so obtuse as to let me directly into the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttrue cause of his wife's nervous attack and his own collectedness, and yet\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\the felt it would not answer to make too light of it before me.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"Mr. and Mrs. M. had just returned from a party. (The party must be the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'scape-goat'!) He assured me that as the lady was in the full enjoyment of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thealth previously, he felt obliged to attribute the cause of her attack\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand speechless condition--for she spoke not one word, or gave a sign--to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe dancing, heated room, and the supper.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"I was fully prepared to realize the powers of ice-cream, cake, oranges,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tchicken-salad, oysters, sugar-plums, punch, and champagne, and at one\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmoment almost concluded to despatch a servant for an emetic of ipecac;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut--I prudently avoided it. Aside from the improbability of excess of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tappetite through the portal of such a mouth, the lovely color of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcheeks and lips utterly forbade a conclusion favorable to Mr. Mackerel's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsolution of the cause.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"I placed my finger on her delicate and jewelled wrist. All seemed calm as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe thought of an angel's breast!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/p><p>\"I was nonplussed. 'Could any tumultuous passion ever have agitated that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbosom so gently swelling in repose?'<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"Mackerel's curious questions touching my sagacity as to his wife's\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcondition received about as satisfactory a solution as do most questions\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tput to me on the cause and treatment of diseases; and having tolerably\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbefogged him with opinions, and lulled his suspicions to rest, by the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tapparent innocent answers to his leading questions, he arrived at the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconclusion most desirable to him, viz., that I was a fool--a conviction\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tquite necessary in some nervous cases....<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"So pleased was Mr. M. with the soothing influences of my brief visit that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\the very courteously waited on me to the outside door, instead of ordering\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta servant to show me out, and astonished me by desiring me to call on the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpatient again in the morning.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"After my usual diversion of investigating 'a pain an' a flutterin' about\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tme heart,' and an 'O, I'm kilt intirely,' I visited Mrs. Mackerel, and had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe extreme pleasure of finding her quite composed, and in conversation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith her fashionable friend, Mrs. Tiptape. The latter was the daughter of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta 'retired milliner,' and had formed a desirable union with Tiptape, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teminent dry goods merchant. Fortunately--for she was a woman of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinfluence--I passed the critical examination of Mrs. T. unscathed by her\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsharp black eyes, and, as the sequel will show, was considered by her\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'quite an agreeable person.'<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"Poor Mrs. Mackerel, notwithstanding her efforts to conceal it, had\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tevidently received some cruel and stunning communication from her husband\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton the night of my summons; her agitated circulation during the fortnight\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof my attendance showed to my conviction some persistent and secret cause\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor her nervousness.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"One evening she assured me that she felt she should now rapidly recover,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas Mr. Mackerel had concluded to take her to Saratoga. I, of course,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tacquiesced in the decision, though my previous opinion had not been asked.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI took a final leave of the lovely woman, and the poor child soon departed\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor Saratoga.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"The ensuing week there was a sheriff's sale at Mackerel's residence. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tday following the Mackerels' departure, Mr. Tiptape did me the honor to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinquire after the health of my family; and a week later, Master Tiptape\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thaving fallen and bumped his dear nose on the floor, I had the felicity of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsoothing the anguish of his mamma in her magnificent _boudoir_, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tholding to her lovely nose the smelling salts, and offering such\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconsolation as her trying position required!\"<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Thus was commenced the practice of one of the first physicians of New\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYork. The facts are avouched for. The names, of course, are manufactured,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto cover the occupation of the parties. The doctor still lives, in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenjoyment of a lucrative and respectable practice, and the love and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tconfidence of his numerous friends and patrons.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Quite as ludicrous scenes could be revealed by most physicians, if they\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twould but take the time to think over their earlier efforts, and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvarious circumstances which were mainly instrumental in getting them into\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta respectable practice.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span>From <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/41595\">\"The Funny Side of Physic\"<\/a> by A.
